# Manish's Fantastic Dump README
Welcome to Manish's Fantastic Dump for NetCDF files!

## Description

This extension is super awesome because it calls ncdump -h when you click on NetCDF files and refreshes as they change (or are replaced). Dont ask me about how intensive it is cuz I don't know, but it's super light I think.

Thanks to ChatGPT for the code ofc!


## Features

- **Automatic ncdump Execution**: Automatically runs `ncdump -h` when you open NetCDF files (`.nc`).
- **Live Refresh**: Refreshes the output as the NetCDF files change or are replaced.
- **Lightweight**: Designed to be not big.
